# DC-Model-Railway-Controller
This software will allow the user to use a custom made controll board along with custom made relay boards, L298N motor driver boards and a raspberry pi to controll a DC model railway.
## Plans
Initially there will only be a windows version availible but once this is working an android app will be developed. This will not be availible on google play but instead must be installed manualy. This may change in the futer but that is unlikely. After completion of both of these pieces of software, the client will be made available in 
.deb format and maybe .rpm. This is expected to happen by December at the latest. Currently there are no plans to make an IOS app or a MacOS client.
