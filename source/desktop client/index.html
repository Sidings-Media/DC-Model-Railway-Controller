        <h1 id="dc-model-railway-controller">DC Model Railway Controller</h1>
        <p>This is an opensource project that aims to produce a comprehensive system for the control of a DC model rail of any guage and any scale. It uses Wi-Fi to comunicate with the<br>
            controlling device. This means that we can have near limitless expansion. The only limit is the number of devices you can have on your network. </p>
        <h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
        <p>At first only a desktop version of the client will be released. It will be released for windows, linux and macOS. Any versions for macOS will be untested due to no machines<br>
            running such an operating system being available. For linux the application will be available in .rpm, .deb and .Appimage formats. For windows there will be a .exe installer.<br>
            After the desktop client is at a stable point in development, work will start on the android app. There are no plans as of current for an IOS app due to the lack of<br>
            availibility of any devices running such an OS.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-boards">The boards</h2>
        <p>The boards are designed using Easy EDA. This software unfortunatly does not intergrate with git so we may switch to KiCad in future. At the moment, although there are some <br>
            designs for boards on GitHub, the most current designs will be available from the <a href="https://easyeda.com/Sidings-Media/">EasyEda Website</a>. All the designs to do <br>
            with this project will be prefixed by <code>Model Railway Control System:</code>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-client-software">The client software</h2>
        <p>The client software is designed using the electron framework with a python backend to comunicate with the boards.</p>
