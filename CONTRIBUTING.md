# Contribute
To contribute simply fork the project and make your changes. Then all you need to do is create a pull request. We aim to proccess pull requests within five working days of 
creation but during busy periods we may take longer. If you want to know all current tasks then please visit our [openproject instance](https://openproject.sidingsmedia.com/projects/sidings-media-railway-controller/).
If you wish to be added to our openproject instance and contribute on a more regular basis then please email [contribute@sidingsmedia.com](mailto:contribute@sidingsmedia.com).
This will allow you to be assigned to tasks and will improve the speed at which new features and bugs can be added and fixed.
